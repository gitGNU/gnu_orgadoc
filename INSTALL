GNU OrgaDoc Installation Guide

You will need the following mandatory programs (with specific versions):
    
	* Gobo 3.3
	* SmartEiffel 1.1
	* Expat library

The below are optional programs but which generate the documentation:
    
	* docbook-utils
	* texinfo

On Trisquel GNU/Linux you need to run "sudo apt-get install libexpat1-dev docbook-utils texinfo". For other distributions, you will need to use their package managers. However the names of the libraries should be the same.

Before moving onto generating the build scripts, add the following to your '.bashrc':
	
	* export SmartEiffel=/usr/lib/smarteiffel/sys/system.se (or another path where it is installed).

Generating (in this order):
	
	* aclocal
	* autoconf
	* automake
	   
Now type './configure' and providing you have everything setup correctly, a makefile will be generated.

Compiling and Installation:

	* type 'make' and you will get a GNU OrgaDoc binary in 'src/'.

To install GNU OrgaDoc onto your system, type 'sudo make install' which will compile and install the program. The default path to the config file is '/usr/local/etc/orgadoc/orgadoc.conf'. The path can be changed in the config file to point to another location for the template files.

For an in-depth usage of GNU OrgaDoc, please read the documentation generated from 'docs/orgadoc.texi'.
