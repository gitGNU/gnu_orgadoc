These files are here to assist others who would like to easily compile or
port the code to a new platform and who don't have (or don't want) an Eiffel development setup.

You can compile the code in the normal way (using GCC) and linked with libexpat (make sure it is the development version).

You would need access to the sudo command to install the binaries from 
this source into the correct directory path.  See the INSTALL file
in the root directory of orgadoc for more details.
